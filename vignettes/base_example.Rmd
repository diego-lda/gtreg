### Introduction and Overview


In this vignette will illustrate the use of `gtreg` with the estimation of a distributional model for head acceleration in a simulated motorcycle accident, used to test crash helmets.

The estimation of distributional regression functions for this dataset is challenging because the shape of the outcome distribution, head acceleration, given time after impact, varies across time.

### 1) Load the necessary packages.

In order to set up this vignette we need to first load the relevant libraries. As well as loading `gtreg` we need to loas the tools for the parallelisation that we will perform later on.

```
library(gtreg)

library(orthogonalsplinebasis)
library(quantreg)
library(splines)
library(MASS)
library(CVXR)
library(robustHD)
library(xtable)
library(speedglm)
library(np)
library(KScorrect)
library(outliers)
library(Hmisc)
library(doParallel)
library(doRNG)
registerDoParallel(makeCluster(detectCores()))
getDoParWorkers()

source("/Users/diegolara/Dropbox/GTR/Rcode/ACS/dnorm2.R")
source("/Users/diegolara/Dropbox/GTR/Rcode/ACS/EvalBasis.R")
source("/Users/diegolara/Dropbox/GTR/Rcode/ACS/inner_gtr_c4.R")
source("/Users/diegolara/Dropbox/GTR/Rcode/ACS/drfunc_basic4.R")
source("/Users/diegolara/Dropbox/GTR/Rcode/ACS/e0func.R")
```


### 2) Load the data.

The dataset consists of 133 consecutive measurements of head acceleration, measured in G forces, throughout the first 60 milliseconds after a crash. This dataset is used as a simple example, that is easy to compute and understand. The data is contained in the `MASS` package.

After we have loaded the dataset onto R, in order to use the data with this package, we set it up and identify its length, `nobs`, and how many dependent variables are continuous. This is stored as the select the number of continuous variables, `ncont`, the number of splines, `nsplines` and a vector that specifies that the dependent variable is continuous `X.type`.

```
library(MASS)
data(mcycle)
attach(mcycle)
x          <- matrix(times,nc=1)
y          <- as.numeric(accel)
nobs       <- length(y)
ncont  <- 1
nspline <- 1
X.type <- "continuous"
```
